# basic-encryption-with-python

Didnt use python for a few months so I made this to help remember what I forgot.

## How To Use
1. open encrypt.py and input your message.
2. put decrypt.py in the same folder as your message file and the key file
3. open decrypt.py and input the name of your message file.
